This book provides an abundance of sample code, most of it in the form of complete programs. Like the previous editions, this book practices generic C++ so that it is not 
tied to any particular kind of computer, operating system, or compiler.Thus, the examples were tested on a Windows 7 system,a Macintosh OS X system,and a Linux system.
Those programs using C++11 features require compilers supporting those features, but the remaining programs should work with any C++99/03-compliant system.
The sample code for the "complete" programs described in this book is available on this book's website. See the registration link given on the back cover for more information.
