capital letters are useful signals for a reader. they have three main purposes: to let the reader know a sentence is beginning, to show important words in a title, and to signal proper names and official titles.

1.  capitals signal the start of a new sentence. this is a stable rule in our written language: whenever you begin a sentence capitalize the first letter of the first word. this includes capitalizing the first word or a direct quotation when it's a full sentence, even if it appears within another sentence.

wow! i never thought i'd survive running the rapids.

frand inquired, "where do i make a donation to the new scholarship fund?". "the first time i lectured on that theory," the professor bragged, "not one student fell asleep in my class."

note: do not capitalize quotations that continue in a sentence after an interruption, as in the sentence immediately above.

modern humans arrived on the indian subcontinent from africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to africa in human genetic diversity.[25] settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the indus valley civilisation of the third millennium bce.[26] by 1200 bce, an archaic form of sanskrit, an indo-european language, had diffused into india from the northwest,[27] unfolding as the language of the rigveda, and recording the dawning of hinduism in india.[28] the dravidian languages of india were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[29] by 400 bce, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within hinduism,[30] and buddhism and jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[31] early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit maurya and gupta empires based in the ganges basin.[32] their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[33] but also marked by the declining status of women,[34] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][35] in south india, the middle kingdoms exported dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of southeast asia.[36]
