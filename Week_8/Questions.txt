Students that have completed the assignment last week will do the following:
1)
a) Make separate .h files for class definition

b) Make .C files for class implementation

c) Have the Application that uses the ADT in a different file

d) Submit your assignment on Moodle.


Additionally:
2) 
Write a Sort function to sort the list l inplace
void Sort ( List &l)
Assume that the List consists of elements of ElementType (user defined).
You must define functions:
int LessThan (ElementType x, ElementType y);
int EqualTo (ElementType x, ElementType y);
which will be used by the Sort function.

Do not use additional arrays or additional Lists.  The sorting must be done inplace.  Any O(n^2) sorting algorithm is fine.
Again .h and .C files must be in separate files -- submit on Moodle.
