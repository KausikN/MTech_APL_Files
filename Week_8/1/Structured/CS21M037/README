#Instructions:

1) The .C/.cpp/.c++ files should be in the "src" folder.
2) The .h files should be in the "include" folder.
3) The intermediate .o files should be in the "obj" folder.
4) The final executable should be in the "bin" folder.
5) Write the commands to compile your program, as per the example given below, in a "cmd.sh" file. Name the final executable (D) as "solution". Please note, the compilation commands may vary from person to person; the example given below is only for demonstration purposes.

Please follow the coding standards while writing program in a structured way as mentioned above.

#Example:
C.h contains the class definition with member-funtion-declarations (only). You should not write the function definition in the .h files.
A.C contains the function definitions for the member-funtions declared in the .h file.
B.C is the main file which contains all the includes.
A.o and B.o are the intermediate object files
D is the the final executable file
 
g++ -g -c src/A.C -o obj/A.o
g++ -g -c src/B.C -o obj/B.o
g++ obj/A.o obj/B.o -o bin/D
